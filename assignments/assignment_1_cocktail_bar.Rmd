# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
```

```{r echo=TRUE, paged.print=TRUE}

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv"
df  <- readr::read_tsv(url)

head(df, 5)

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

I'd like to use a simple regex, which, after splitting the ingredients by the <br> tag, removes the first word after the number. But first, I want to make sure that this rule is consitent: number + quantity + ingredient

```{r}
# Split the ingredients column into individual ingredient lines
non_numeric_starters <- df %>%
  # Separate the ingredient string into a list of strings
  mutate(ingredient_list = str_split(ingredients, "<br/>")) %>%
  # Explode the list of ingredients into separate rows
  unnest(ingredient_list) %>%
  # Trim whitespace from the start/end of each ingredient line
  mutate(ingredient_line = str_trim(ingredient_list)) %>%
  # Filter for lines that DO NOT start with a digit
  # The regex "^\\d" matches a digit at the start of the string.
  filter(!str_detect(ingredient_line, "^\\d")) %>%
  select(ingredient_line) %>%
  distinct()

datatable(non_numeric_starters)
```

The result is empty, so I go with my simple rule to save some monster regex from being born.

```{r}
cleaned_ingredients <- df %>%
  # Split and unnest ingredients
  mutate(ingredient_list = str_split(ingredients, "<br/>|<b4/>|<br>")) %>%
  unnest(ingredient_list) %>%
  # Trim initial whitespace
  mutate(ingredient_line = str_trim(ingredient_list)) %>%

  # Apply the cleaning rule:
  # Remove number + first word (the unit) + everything in between.
  mutate(
    cleaned_name = str_replace(
      ingredient_line,
      # This is transparently generated with LLM. After 7 years in IT, I'm still terrified of Regex.
      # Regex:
      # ^[\\d\\./\\s-]+: Match the number/quantity part at the start (1, 3/4, 2.5, etc.).
      # [^a-zA-Z]*: Match any non-letter characters (spaces, commas, etc.).
      # \\s*: Match any trailing whitespace.
      "^[\\d\\./\\s-]+[^a-zA-Z]*[a-zA-Z]+\\s*",
      "" # Replace the matched prefix with an empty string
    )
  ) %>%
  # Remove the abv
  mutate(
    cleaned_name = str_replace(
      cleaned_name,
      "\\s*\\([\\d\\.]+%\\s*abv\\)",
      ""
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(cleaned_name = str_trim(cleaned_name)) %>%
  filter(cleaned_name != "", !is.na(cleaned_name))
  
distinct_ingredients <- cleaned_ingredients %>%
  distinct(cleaned_name)

# Print the resulting list of distinct ingredients
datatable(distinct_ingredients)
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
distinct_ingredients_in_alphabetic = distinct_ingredients %>%
  arrange(cleaned_name)
datatable(distinct_ingredients_in_alphabetic)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
datatable(distinct_ingredients %>%
  count(name = "ingredients_count")
)
```

There are 62 unique ingredients.

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top10_ingredients <- cleaned_ingredients %>%
  count(cleaned_name, sort = TRUE, name = "occurence") %>%   # counts & sorts desc
  slice_head(n = 10)

datatable(top10_ingredients)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
ingredient_counts <- cleaned_ingredients %>%
  count(name, name = "n_ingredients")

max_n <- max(ingredient_counts$n_ingredients)

cocktails_with_max <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(n_ingredients == max_n)
datatable(cocktails_with_max)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
ingredient_counts <- cleaned_ingredients %>%
  distinct(name, cleaned_name) %>%   # avoid double-counting within one cocktail
  count(cleaned_name, name = "n_cocktails")

rare_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(n_cocktails == 1)

datatable(rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
cocktails_with_rare <- cleaned_ingredients %>%
  semi_join(rare_ingredients, by = "cleaned_name") %>%
  distinct(name)
datatable(cocktails_with_rare)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktails_without_rare <- cleaned_ingredients %>%
  distinct(name) %>%
  anti_join(cocktails_with_rare, by = "name")
datatable(cocktails_without_rare)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

cocktail_matrix <- cleaned_ingredients %>%
  distinct(name, cleaned_name) %>%     # ensure no duplicate pairs
  mutate(value = "X") %>%              # mark presence
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = cleaned_name,
    values_from = value,
    values_fill = ""
  )
datatable(cocktail_matrix)
```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
